# Transit Gateway in a Multi-Account Deployment

The Transit GateWay (TGW) feature provides a managed virtual router for the AWS VPC customers. Multiple VPCs, VPNs and DX Gateways can be attached to the TGW to perform IP routing between them. Multiple route tables can live inside a single TGW and be routed according to the customer business use case.
